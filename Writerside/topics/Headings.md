# Headings

When choosing an HTML tag to represent a heading, Vendi recommends only using an `h1`
through `h6` tag if the text is part of the document's outline. If text doesn't meet
this criteria, use a `div` or `span` tag instead. Vendi has created CSS classes of
`h1` through `h6` that mimic the styles of the corresponding heading tags.
