# Widgets

## Text field

A text field is a single line of text.

## Dropdown

A dropdown is a list of options that can be selected by the user, and is represented by
an HTML `<select>` element. Dropdowns are always required, however a system default
will always be set.

## Flexible content

Flexible content is a collection of components or sub-components that can be added to a
component. When adding a row to a flexible content field, if two or more templates have
been previously been created (by the development team), the user will be presented with
a dropdown or picker to select the template to use for the new row. If only one template
exists, the user will not be presented with a dropdown or picker, and the template will
be automatically selected.
